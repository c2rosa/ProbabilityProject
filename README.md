This small Java code simulates a solution to the following problem.....

You put three cards in a hat.

One card has a black dot on each side.

One card has a red dot on each side.

One card has a black dot on one side and a red dot on the other.

You pull a card out of the hat and see a red dot on the side facing you.

What is the probability, expressed as a fraction, that when you turn the card over the other side will also be red? The answer is not 1/2.

The answer is 2/3.
